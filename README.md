San Francisco has become an industrial market and with growing populations comes growing competitions, which often leads to crimes. The city has had a considerable crime record in the past. There are a lot of people who move in the bay area every year and having knowledge of the crime rate in the city would help them make appropriate accommodation decisions. I’m planning to give the user a summarized view of the following components:

•	Crime density based on location. This will also give an insight into how many crimes took place in what places.

•	A comparison between white collar crimes and blue collar crimes. Again based on locations, the crimes will be highlighted based on if they are white collar or blue collar. It will also give the user a view of the places with most crimes.

•	Resolution. This will give the user an insight into what actions were taken for what kind of crimes. Basically we’re looking for high profile crimes that went unattended or were tended with least intensity, if any. The user should know the kind of actions taken in case of a crime so that it ensures that safety.

•	Time and date and day. Crime density will be displayed based on the time and the day of the week they occurred, so that the user has an insight into what days and times are safer than the rest.
